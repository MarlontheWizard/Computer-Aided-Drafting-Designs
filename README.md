# Computer-Aided-Drafting-Designs
Repository to track and store my personal CADD designs. 
Each design has a PDF file, it gives an accurate representation of the design and is useful for users without the required software.
**In the case that the images do not load inside the PDF file, make sure that you press "Trust Document" to allow the multimedia to load, then rechoose a photo to view**
